   It provides features such as:
1) registration of identities, or connects to LDAP as the user registry;
2) issuance of Enrollment Certificates (ECerts);
3) issuance of Transaction Certificates (TCerts), providing both anonymity and unlinkability when transacting on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain;
4) certificate renewal and revocation.

   Hyperledger Fabric Glossary
   
   Blockchain Network
A blockchain network consists of, at minimum, one peer (responsible for endorsing and committing transactions) 
leveraging an ordering service, and a membership services component (certificate authority) 
that distributes and revokes cryptographic certificates representative of user identities and permissions.

区块链网络
区块链网络包括，
至少，一个对等点（负责签署和提交事务）利用一个订购服务，以及会员服务组件（证书权威），分配和撤销代表用户的身份和权限的加密证书。



Permissioned Network

A blockchain network where any entity (node) is required to maintain a member identity on the network. 
End users must be authorized and authenticated in order to use the network.

被许可网络
在区块链网络中任何实体（节点）需要保持对网络成员的身份。为了使用网络，必须对终端用户进行授权和认证。



Peer
Peer is a component that executes, and maintains a ledger of, transactions.   There are two roles for a peer – endorser and committer.  
The architecture has been designed such that a peer is always a committer, but not necessarily always an endorser. 
Peers play no role in the ordering of transactions.

对等点
对等点是一个执行和维护帐本事务的组件。分为背书人和提交者两个角色。
该架构的设计是这样的，一个对等点是一个提交者，但不一定是背书人。对等点在事务的排序中不起作用。


Member

A Member is a participant (such as a company or organization) that operates components - Peers, Orderers, and applications 
- in the blockchain network.  A member is identified by its CA certificate (i.e. a unique enrollment).   
A Member’s peer will be leveraged by end users in order to perform transaction operations on specific channels.

成员
一个成员是一个参与者（比如一个公司或组织）在区块链网络中操作各服务部件(peer orderer 和程序应用)的参与者。成员通过其CA证书（即唯一注册）来标识。
成员的对等点将由最终用户使用，以便在特定的通道上执行事务操作。
